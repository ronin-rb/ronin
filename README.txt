== DESCRIPTION:

Ronin is a ruby development environment geared towards information security
and data exploration tasks. Ronin allows for the rapid development and
distribution of code over most Source-Code-Management system.

== PHILOSOPHY:

Ronin's philosophy was heavily influenced by the Hackety Manifesto written 
by why the lucky stiff. The development of Ronin was done with the mindset
that information security and data exploration programming should be fun, not
tedious and complex. Furthermore, well written tools and API shouldn't cost
exorbent sums of money nor come with incumbering licenses that restricts the
users abilities. Such tools and APIs should be easily accessible to all and
promote sharing of works created within them.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

== INSTALL:

sudo gem install ronin
